Change the default name and email address on outgoing WordPress emails (e.g. Password Reset).

== Description ==
= Put a human face on emails sent from your WordPress website! =

System generated emails, for example the message triggered by the ‘lost password’ link, have a default value of “WordPress” in the ‘From’ field. 

This means your users will receive a message from someone named *WordPress* who has the email address *wordpress@yourdomain.com*. 

With this plugin you can make things look a bit more professional by changing the default name and email address on all outgoing WordPress emails to values of your choice.
